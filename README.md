# üî• Mbo√Ætat√° - The Blazing Sentinel of the Web

**Mbo√Ætat√°** is a handcrafted proxy written in ü¶Ä Rust, forged with the flames of Brazilian folklore. Its purpose burns bright: to intercept and collect sensitive and strategic web artifacts like `.js`, `.map`, backend URLs, keys, and other hidden treasures from HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an early-stage project, built as a learning experience. Some flames still flicker, but it already packs enough heat to scorch some bugs! üå∂Ô∏è

## üîç Purpose

To assist in collecting valuable data during web application reconnaissance. Mbo√Ætat√° intercepts both HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses, saving useful files that often reveal:

* JavaScript source code
* Debug `.map` files
* Internal URLs and endpoints
* Secrets, API keys, tokens
* Internal configurations (`.env`, `.conf`, etc.)

---

## üîß How to Use

```bash
cargo run
```

The tool is still in its early stage, but it already supports:

* Starting a basic HTTP proxy
* Saving files based on their extension
* Preparing the structure for more advanced analysis stages
